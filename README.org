* Vagrant setup for Seajure hack nights.
As an attempt to get a reasonable development environment quickly for Seajure hacknights, I setup a shareable virtualbox via Vagrant. Let's all play along!
** Setup
   - Install VirtualBox 4.x: http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
   - Install VirtualBox Extension Pack: http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.0.8/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.0.8-71778.vbox-extpack
   - gem install vagrant
   - vagrant up # inside the directory containing this readme
** Contents
   - Emacs 24 (with starter kit 2)
   - tmux (with better config)
   - Leiningen
   - Jark
