* Vagrant setup for Seajure hack nights.
As an attempt to get a reasonable development environment quickly for Seajure hacknights, I setup a shareable virtualbox via Vagrant. Let's all play along!
** Setup
   - Install [[http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads][VirtualBox 4.x]]
   - Install [[http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.0.8/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.0.8-71778.vbox-extpack][VirtualBox Extension Pack]]
   - =gem install vagrant= # install rubygems first if necessary
   - =vagrant up= # inside the directory containing this readme
** Usage
   Once Vagrant provisions your VM, use =vagrant ssh= to log in. Your
   VM will have a Jark swank session running, so you can immediately
   start Emacs and do =M-x slime-connect= to port 4005. You can start
   a new project with =lein new myproject= or pull down an existing
   project to hack on via git.
** Contents
   - Emacs 24 (with starter kit 2 and relevant Clojure modes)
   - tmux (with better config)

   - [[http://icylisper.in/jark/][Jark]]
